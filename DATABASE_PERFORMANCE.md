# Database Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

Comprehensive database performance optimizations including indexes, connection pooling, query monitoring, and backup strategies.

## Index Strategy

### Migration 007: Performance Indexes

**Created:** `migrations/007_add_performance_indexes.sql`

**Total Indexes Added:** 45+ indexes across 11 tables

### Index Categories

#### 1. Single Column Indexes
Fast lookups on frequently filtered columns:
- `idx_players_status` - Filter by player status
- `idx_games_status` - Filter by game status
- `idx_games_season` - Filter by season
- `idx_player_injuries_status` - Filter by injury status

#### 2. Composite Indexes
Multi-column filtering (order matters!):
- `idx_players_position_status` - Position + status queries
- `idx_players_team_position` - Team + position queries
- `idx_games_season_week_date` - Season + week + date queries
- `idx_game_stats_player_season` - Player + season stats

#### 3. Covering Indexes
Include frequently selected columns to avoid table lookups:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_players_team_covering ON players(team_id)
    INCLUDE (name, position, jersey_number, status);
```

**Benefit:** Query can be answered entirely from index (index-only scan)

#### 4. Partial Indexes
Index subset of data for faster queries:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_players_active ON players(team_id, position)
    WHERE status = 'active';
```

**Benefit:** Smaller index size, faster queries on active players only

#### 5. Text Search Indexes (GIN + Trigram)
Fast fuzzy text search:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_players_name_trgm ON players USING gin(name gin_trgm_ops);
```

**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM players WHERE name % 'Mahomes';  -- Fuzzy match
SELECT * FROM players WHERE name ILIKE '%mahomes%';  -- Case-insensitive
```

### Index Usage by Table

#### Teams (4 indexes)
- `idx_teams_abbreviation` - Lookup by abbreviation (KC, BUF)
- `idx_teams_name_trgm` - Text search on team name

#### Players (9 indexes)
- `idx_players_nfl_id` - Lookup by ESPN ID
- `idx_players_team_id` - Filter by team
- `idx_players_position` - Filter by position
- `idx_players_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_players_position_status` - Composite filter
- `idx_players_team_position` - Team roster queries
- `idx_players_name_lower` - Case-insensitive name search
- `idx_players_name_trgm` - Fuzzy name search
- `idx_players_active` - Active players only (partial)
- `idx_players_team_covering` - Team queries with player details (covering)

#### Games (8 indexes)
- `idx_games_game_date` - Sort by date
- `idx_games_season_week` - Season + week lookup
- `idx_games_home_team` - Home team games
- `idx_games_away_team` - Away team games
- `idx_games_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_games_season` - Filter by season
- `idx_games_season_week_date` - Composite for scheduling
- `idx_games_season_week_covering` - Game details (covering)
- `idx_games_recent_season` - Recent games only (partial)

#### Game Stats (5 indexes)
- `idx_game_stats_player_id` - Player stats lookup
- `idx_game_stats_game_id` - Game stats lookup
- `idx_game_stats_season` - Season stats
- `idx_game_stats_player_game` - Player in game (composite)
- `idx_game_stats_season_week` - Week stats
- `idx_game_stats_player_season` - Player season stats
- `idx_game_stats_player_covering` - Player stats with details (covering)

#### Player Injuries (4 indexes)
- `idx_player_injuries_player` - Player's injuries
- `idx_player_injuries_team` - Team injuries
- `idx_player_injuries_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_player_injuries_player_status` - Player + status
- `idx_injuries_current` - Current injuries (partial)

#### Defensive Stats (12 indexes)
Various indexes for defensive rankings and player vs defense queries

### Index Maintenance

#### Analyze Tables
Update statistics for query planner:
```sql
ANALYZE teams;
ANALYZE players;
ANALYZE games;
-- ... etc
```

**When to run:**
- After bulk inserts
- After significant data changes
- Weekly in production

#### Check Index Usage
```sql
-- Find unused indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0
AND indexrelname NOT LIKE 'pg_toast%'
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;

-- Index size
SELECT indexname, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid))
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;
```

#### Rebuild Indexes (if needed)
```sql
REINDEX TABLE players;
REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_players_team_id;
```

## Connection Pooling Optimization

### Current Configuration

**File:** `internal/db/postgres.go`

```go
poolConfig.MaxConns = 25        // Max connections
poolConfig.MinConns = 5         // Min connections
poolConfig.MaxConnLifetime = 1 * time.Hour
poolConfig.MaxConnIdleTime = 30 * time.Minute
poolConfig.HealthCheckPeriod = 1 * time.Minute
```

### Optimal Settings by Environment

#### Development
```go
MaxConns: 10
MinConns: 2
```

#### Staging
```go
MaxConns: 25
MinConns: 5
```

#### Production (Small)
```go
MaxConns: 50
MinConns: 10
```

#### Production (Large)
```go
MaxConns: 100
MinConns: 20
```

### Pool Sizing Formula

```
MaxConns = ((core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count)
```

**Example:**
- 4 CPU cores
- 1 disk (effective spindles)
- MaxConns = (4 * 2) + 1 = 9
- Round up to 10-15 for safety

### Monitor Pool Health

```go
stats := pool.Stat()
log.Printf("Pool - Acquired: %d, Idle: %d, Max: %d",
    stats.AcquiredConns(),
    stats.IdleConns(),
    stats.MaxConns(),
)
```

**Metrics to track:**
- `AcquiredConns()` - Currently in use
- `IdleConns()` - Available for reuse
- `NewConnsCount()` - Total created
- `AcquireCount()` - Total acquisitions

**Warning signs:**
- `AcquiredConns` always near `MaxConns` → Increase MaxConns
- `IdleConns` always near `MaxConns` → Decrease MaxConns
- High `AcquireDuration` → Connection contention

## Query Performance Monitoring

### Slow Query Logging

**Already implemented in Phase 1:**
```go
// pkg/logging/logger.go
func SlowQuery(ctx context.Context, query string, durationMs int64) {
    requestID := GetRequestID(ctx)
    log.Printf("[SLOW-QUERY] [%s] Query took %dms: %s", requestID, durationMs, query)
}
```

**Usage in queries:**
```go
start := time.Now()
rows, err := pool.Query(ctx, query, args...)
duration := time.Since(start).Milliseconds()

if duration > 100 {
    logging.SlowQuery(ctx, query, duration)
}
```

### Query Execution Plan Analysis

**Check query performance:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.id, p.name, p.position
FROM players p
WHERE p.team_id = '...' AND p.position = 'QB';
```

**Look for:**
- `Seq Scan` → Add index
- `Index Scan` → Good!
- `Index Only Scan` → Excellent! (covering index)
- High `cost` → Optimize query

### Enable PostgreSQL Query Stats

```sql
-- Enable pg_stat_statements extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;

-- View slow queries
SELECT
    query,
    calls,
    total_exec_time,
    mean_exec_time,
    max_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_exec_time > 100  -- >100ms average
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Query Performance Metrics

**Track in handlers:**
```go
// Before query
startTime := time.Now()
requestID := logging.GetRequestID(ctx)

// After query
duration := time.Since(startTime).Milliseconds()

// Log metrics
metrics := map[string]interface{}{
    "request_id": requestID,
    "query": "ListPlayers",
    "duration_ms": duration,
    "rows_returned": len(results),
}

if duration > 100 {
    logging.Warn(ctx, "Slow query: %+v", metrics)
}
```

## N+1 Query Optimization

### Common N+1 Patterns

#### Problem: Loading players with team names
```go
// BAD: N+1 query
for _, player := range players {
    team, _ := queries.GetTeamByID(ctx, player.TeamID)  // 1 query per player!
    player.TeamName = team.Name
}
```

#### Solution: JOIN in single query
```go
// GOOD: Single query with JOIN
query := `
    SELECT p.id, p.name, p.position, t.name as team_name
    FROM players p
    LEFT JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
    WHERE p.position = $1
`
```

### Batch Loading Pattern

```go
// Load all teams at once
teamIDs := make([]uuid.UUID, len(players))
for i, p := range players {
    teamIDs[i] = p.TeamID
}

teams, _ := queries.GetTeamsByIDs(ctx, teamIDs)  // Single query

// Map teams to players
teamMap := make(map[uuid.UUID]*models.Team)
for _, team := range teams {
    teamMap[team.ID] = team
}

for i, player := range players {
    if team, ok := teamMap[player.TeamID]; ok {
        players[i].Team = team
    }
}
```

### Example: Game Stats with Player/Team Details

**Before (N+1):**
```go
stats, _ := queries.GetGameStats(ctx, gameID)  // 1 query

for _, stat := range stats {
    player, _ := queries.GetPlayerByID(ctx, stat.PlayerID)  // N queries
    stat.PlayerName = player.Name
}
```

**After (Single Query):**
```go
query := `
    SELECT
        gs.id, gs.passing_yards, gs.rushing_yards,
        p.name as player_name, p.position,
        t.abbreviation as team_abbr
    FROM game_stats gs
    JOIN players p ON gs.player_id = p.id
    LEFT JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
    WHERE gs.game_id = $1
`
rows, _ := pool.Query(ctx, query, gameID)  // 1 query total
```

## Database Backup Strategy

### Heroku Postgres Backups

#### Enable Daily Backups
```bash
# Attach Heroku Postgres add-on with backup capability
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:standard-0 --app gridironmind

# Enable automatic daily backups
heroku pg:backups:schedule DATABASE_URL --at '02:00 America/New_York' --app gridironmind
```

#### Manual Backup
```bash
# Create backup
heroku pg:backups:capture --app gridironmind

# List backups
heroku pg:backups --app gridironmind

# Download backup
heroku pg:backups:download --app gridironmind
```

#### Restore from Backup
```bash
# Restore latest backup
heroku pg:backups:restore --app gridironmind

# Restore specific backup
heroku pg:backups:restore b101 DATABASE_URL --app gridironmind
```

### Local Backup Script

**Create:** `scripts/backup-database.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="backups"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > "$BACKUP_DIR/gridironmind_$DATE.sql"

# Compress backup
gzip "$BACKUP_DIR/gridironmind_$DATE.sql"

# Keep only last 30 days
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "*.sql.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

echo "✅ Backup complete: gridironmind_$DATE.sql.gz"
```

### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

**Heroku Postgres Premium features:**
- Continuous protection
- Rollback to any point in time
- Up to 4 days of retention

```bash
# Rollback to specific time
heroku pg:backups:restore --at '2025-10-01 14:30:00' --app gridironmind
```

### Backup Verification

**Test restore monthly:**
```bash
# Create staging database
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app gridironmind-staging

# Restore backup to staging
heroku pg:backups:restore b101 STAGING_DATABASE --app gridironmind-staging

# Verify data
heroku pg:psql STAGING_DATABASE --app gridironmind-staging
```

## Monitoring Queries

### Check Database Size
```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('gridironmind'));
```

### Check Table Sizes
```sql
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

### Check Index Sizes
```sql
SELECT
    indexname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;
```

### Check Connection Count
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

### Check Long-Running Queries
```sql
SELECT
    pid,
    now() - query_start AS duration,
    query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active'
AND now() - query_start > interval '1 second'
ORDER BY duration DESC;
```

### Check Cache Hit Ratio
```sql
SELECT
    sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
    sum(heap_blks_hit)  as heap_hit,
    sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;
```

**Target:** >99% cache hit ratio

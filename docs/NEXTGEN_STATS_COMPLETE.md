## Implementation Details

### Data Source

**NFLverse GitHub Releases:**
- URL Pattern: `https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/download/nextgen_stats/ngs_{type}_{season}.csv`
- Available Types: `passing`, `rushing`, `receiving`
- Format: CSV with header row
- Filters: Regular season only (`season_type = "REG"`)

### CSV Parsing

The ingestion service downloads and parses CSV files:

```go
// Column index mapping
colIndex := make(map[string]int)
for i, col := range header {
    colIndex[col] = i
}

// Extract values safely
value := getCSVFloat(row, colIndex, "avg_time_to_throw")
```

Helper functions:
- `getCSVValue(row, colIndex, column)` - Get string value
- `getCSVInt(row, colIndex, column)` - Parse integer
- `getCSVFloat(row, colIndex, column)` - Parse decimal

### Player Matching

Three-stage player matching strategy:

1. **Exact Match (with team):**
   ```sql
   SELECT p.id FROM players p
   JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
   WHERE LOWER(p.name) = LOWER($1) AND t.abbreviation = $2
   ```

2. **Fuzzy Match (with team):**
   ```sql
   WHERE LOWER(p.name) LIKE LOWER('%lastName%') AND t.abbreviation = $2
   ```

3. **Fallback (no team filter):**
   ```sql
   WHERE LOWER(p.name) = LOWER($1)
   ```

**Match Rate:** ~85-90% (depends on roster completeness)

### Database Storage

**Table:** `advanced_stats`

**Unique Constraint:** `(player_id, season, week, stat_type)`

**Upsert Pattern:**
```sql
INSERT INTO advanced_stats (...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (player_id, season, week, stat_type)
DO UPDATE SET
  avg_time_to_throw = EXCLUDED.avg_time_to_throw,
  ...
  updated_at = NOW()
```

**Week Handling:**
- `week = NULL` → Season totals
- `week = 1-18` → Weekly stats

**Stat Type:**
- `'passing'` → Passing fields populated, others NULL
- `'rushing'` → Rushing fields populated, others NULL
- `'receiving'` → Receiving fields populated, others NULL

## Usage Examples

### Sync Workflow

**Step 1: Sync 2024 Season (All Types)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://nfl.wearemachina.com/api/v1/admin/sync/nextgen-stats \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-admin-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"season": 2024, "stat_type": "all"}'
```

**Step 2: Query Player Stats**
```bash
# Get Patrick Mahomes' 2024 passing NGS
curl "https://nfl.wearemachina.com/api/v1/players/{mahomes-id}/advanced-stats?season=2024&stat_type=passing"
```

**Step 3: Compare Weekly Performance**
```bash
# Get week-by-week receiving stats
curl "https://nfl.wearemachina.com/api/v1/players/{hill-id}/advanced-stats?season=2024&stat_type=receiving"
```

### Backfill Historical Data

```bash
# Sync 2020-2024 passing stats (background)
curl -X POST https://nfl.wearemachina.com/api/v1/admin/sync/nextgen-stats \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-admin-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_season": 2020,
    "end_season": 2024,
    "stat_type": "passing"
  }'
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Sync Performance

**Single Season (Passing):**
- CSV Download: 1-3 seconds
- Parsing: 2-5 seconds
- Database Inserts: 3-8 seconds
- **Total: 6-16 seconds**

**Single Season (All Types):**
- 3x single type time
- **Total: ~30-50 seconds (background)**

**Multi-Season Range:**
- 5 seasons × 50 seconds = 4-5 minutes
- **Always runs in background**

### Query Performance

- **Indexed:** `(player_id)`, `(season)`, `(stat_type)`
- **Typical Response Time:** <100ms
- **No Caching:** Direct database queries (data changes infrequently)

## Data Quality

### Coverage

| Stat Type | Players Per Season | Weeks Available |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Passing | ~40-60 QBs | 1-18 + season totals |
| Rushing | ~80-120 RBs/QBs | 1-18 + season totals |
| Receiving | ~150-200 WRs/TEs | 1-18 + season totals |

### Accuracy

- **Source:** NFLverse (official NFL Next Gen Stats)
- **Update Frequency:** Weekly during season
- **Player Matching:** ~85-90% automatic
- **Unmatched Players:** Logged for manual review

### Known Limitations

1. **Player Name Matching:**
   - NFLverse uses display names (e.g., "P. Mahomes")
   - Our database may have different name format
   - Fuzzy matching helps but not 100%

2. **Team Trades:**
   - Player may have changed teams mid-season
   - Fallback logic handles this (searches without team filter)

3. **Rookies/New Players:**
   - Must exist in players table first
   - Run roster sync before NGS sync

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**404 from NFLverse:**
```
NFLverse returned status 404 for https://github.com/...
```
**Cause:** Season/stat type not yet available
**Solution:** Check NFLverse releases for data availability

**Player Not Found:**
```
Could not find player: Patrick Mahomes (KC)
```
**Cause:** Player not in database or name mismatch
**Solution:** Run roster sync or check player names

**CSV Parse Error:**
```
Error reading CSV row: record on line X: wrong number of fields
```
**Cause:** Malformed CSV or NFLverse data change
**Solution:** Check NFLverse data format, update column mappings

## Monitoring

### Logging

All sync operations log:
- Start/completion messages
- Row counts (processed/inserted/skipped)
- Player matching failures
- Errors with stack traces

**Example Log Output:**
```
Syncing Next Gen Stats (passing) for season 2024...
Fetching from: https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/...
Found 156 columns in CSV
Could not find player: J. Smith (NYJ)
Next Gen Stats (passing) sync complete: 450 rows processed, 412 inserted, 38 skipped
```

### Metrics

Track via logs:
- **Match Rate:** `inserted / processed`
- **Sync Time:** Start to completion
- **Error Rate:** Failed inserts

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Player GSIS ID Mapping**
   - Add `gsis_id` column to players table
   - Use GSIS ID for 100% accurate matching
   - Fallback to name matching if needed

2. **Caching**
   - Cache advanced stats queries (15-30 min TTL)
   - Cache key: `advanced_stats:{player_id}:{season}:{week}:{type}`

3. **Aggregation Endpoints**
   - League leaders in NGS metrics
   - Position group averages
   - Team-level aggregations

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Weekly auto-sync during season
   - Webhook triggers from NFLverse
   - Delta updates (only new weeks)

5. **Data Validation**
   - Range checks on NGS values
   - Outlier detection
   - Quality scores

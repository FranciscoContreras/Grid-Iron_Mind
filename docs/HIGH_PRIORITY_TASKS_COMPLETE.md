# High-Priority Tasks - Implementation Complete

## Overview

All high-priority tasks from COMPREHENSIVE_API_SUMMARY.md have been successfully implemented and are ready for production use.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Populate Team Stats - `game_team_stats` Table

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation:**
- File: `internal/ingestion/team_stats.go` (370 lines)
- Functions:
  - `SyncTeamStats(season, week)` - Sync specific week
  - `SyncTeamStatsForSeason(season)` - Sync entire season
  - `syncGameTeamStats()` - Per-game sync logic
  - `parseTeamStats()` - ESPN boxscore parser

**Admin Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/admin/sync/team-stats
{
  "season": 2025,
  "week": 4
}
```

**Query Endpoint:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/games/{game-id}/stats
# Returns team statistics for both teams in a game
```

**ESPN Statistics Mapped:**
- 16+ box score fields parsed
- Efficiency strings ("5-12" → conversions/attempts)
- Possession time, penalties, turnovers, yards
- Idempotent upsert with UNIQUE(game_id, team_id)

**Documentation:**
- `docs/TEAM_STATS_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `docs/TEAM_STATS_API_READY.md` - Testing guide

---

### 2. API Handlers - Expose New Tables

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Endpoints Implemented:**

**Team Stats:**
- `GET /api/v1/games/:id/stats` ✅ - Team stats per game (both teams)
- Returns comprehensive box score with team names/abbreviations

**Admin Sync:**
- `POST /api/v1/admin/sync/team-stats` ✅ - Sync team stats by week
- `POST /api/v1/admin/sync/rosters` ✅ - Sync all team rosters
- `POST /api/v1/admin/sync/weather` ✅ - Weather enrichment by season

**Handler Files:**
- `internal/handlers/games.go` - `HandleGameStats()` for team stats queries
- `internal/handlers/admin.go` - All sync endpoints wired up
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Routes configured

---

### 3. Full Roster Sync

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation:**
- File: `internal/ingestion/service.go`
- Function: `SyncAllRosters(ctx)` (line 145)

**How It Works:**
1. Queries all 32 teams from database
2. Calls ESPN API for each team's roster
3. Upserts players to database
4. 2-second delay between requests (rate limiting)
5. Runs in background (async)

**Admin Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/admin/sync/rosters
# Response: {"message": "Rosters sync started in background", "status": "processing"}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Fetches all 32 NFL team rosters
- ✅ Updates player details (position, jersey, height, weight, status)
- ✅ Links players to teams via team_id FK
- ✅ Handles inactive/injured players
- ✅ Rate limiting to avoid ESPN throttling
- ✅ Cache invalidation on completion

**Performance:**
- ~32 teams × 2 seconds = ~64 seconds total
- Runs asynchronously in background

---

### 4. Weather Enrichment

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation:**
- File: `internal/ingestion/service.go`
- Function: `EnrichGamesWithWeather(ctx, season)` (line 663)

**How It Works:**
1. Queries all games for season with stadium coordinates
2. Fetches historical weather from WeatherAPI
3. Updates games table with 11 weather fields
4. Only enriches games missing weather data
5. Runs in background (async)

**Admin Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/admin/sync/weather
{
  "season": 2024  # Optional, defaults to current year
}
# Response: {"message": "Weather enrichment started for season 2024", "status": "processing"}
```

**Weather Data Fields:**
- `weather_temp` - Temperature in °F
- `weather_condition` - Text description (e.g., "Clear", "Light rain")
- `weather_wind_speed` - Wind speed in mph
- `weather_humidity` - Humidity percentage
- `weather_wind_dir` - Wind direction
- `weather_pressure` - Atmospheric pressure in mb
- `weather_visibility` - Visibility in miles
- `weather_feels_like` - Feels-like temperature
- `weather_precipitation` - Precipitation in inches
- `weather_cloud_cover` - Cloud cover percentage
- `is_day_game` - Boolean (kickoff before 5pm)

**Features:**
- ✅ Uses stadium coordinates (lat/lon) for accuracy
- ✅ Historical weather data from WeatherAPI
- ✅ Only updates games missing weather (idempotent)
- ✅ Rate limiting (500ms between requests)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging with city/state
- ✅ Async background processing

**Performance:**
- ~300 games/season × 500ms = ~2.5 minutes per season
- Free tier: 1M API calls/month (plenty of headroom)

## How to Use - Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Sync Teams (One-Time)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/sync/teams" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-admin-key"
```

### Step 2: Sync Rosters (Weekly)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/sync/rosters" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-admin-key"
```

### Step 3: Sync Games Schedule
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/sync/games" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-admin-key"
```

### Step 4: Sync Team Stats (After Games Complete)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/sync/team-stats" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-admin-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"season": 2025, "week": 4}'
```

### Step 5: Enrich with Weather (Historical)
```bash

```

### Step 6: Query the Data

**Get team stats for a game:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/games/{game-id}/stats"
```

**Get games with weather data:**

  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"season\": $(date +\%Y), \"week\": $(($(date +\%U) - 35))}"

# Every Monday at 9 AM - Update rosters
0 9 * * 1 curl -X POST "https://nfl.wearemachina.com/api/v1/admin/sync/rosters" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"

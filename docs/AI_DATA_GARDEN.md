# üå± AI Data Garden - Self-Maintaining NFL Database

## Vision

Transform the Grid Iron Mind API into a **self-maintaining, self-healing, AI-powered data ecosystem** that grows and improves automatically. Like a beautiful garden, the AI tends to the data - identifying gaps, fixing issues, enriching content, and ensuring everything is fresh and accessible.

## Core Principles

1. **Self-Healing**: AI automatically detects and fixes data quality issues
2. **Self-Enriching**: AI fills in missing data and enhances existing records
3. **Self-Optimizing**: AI learns access patterns and optimizes accordingly
4. **Self-Explaining**: Data is easily accessible through natural language
5. **Predictive**: AI anticipates needs before users ask

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

### 1. **Data Gardener** - Health Monitoring & Auto-Healing

**Location**: `internal/ai/data_gardener.go`

**What it does**:
- Continuously monitors database health
- Detects data quality issues (staleness, gaps, anomalies)
- Automatically fixes low-risk issues
- Provides health reports with AI insights

**Features**:

```go
gardener := ai.NewDataGardener(aiService)

// Run health check
report, _ := gardener.RunHealthCheck(ctx)

// Report includes:
// - Overall health score (excellent/good/fair/poor)
// - Detected issues with severity levels
// - AI-generated recommendations
// - Auto-fixed issue count
```

**Issue Detection**:
- **Staleness**: Games past date still marked "scheduled"
- **Missing Data**: Teams without players, games without stats
- **Anomalies**: Invalid scores, duplicate players
- **Inconsistencies**: Data that doesn't match patterns

**Auto-Healing**:
- Low/medium severity issues fixed automatically
- High severity issues flagged for review
- All fixes logged with reasoning

---

### 2. **Data Enricher** - Intelligent Gap Filling

**Location**: `internal/ai/data_enricher.go`

**What it does**:
- Identifies missing player/team data
- Uses AI to suggest accurate values
- Generates metadata (tags, summaries, comparisons)
- Creates relationships between entities

**Features**:

```go
enricher := ai.NewDataEnricher(aiService)

// Find and fill missing data
suggestions, _ := enricher.EnrichPlayer(ctx, player)

// Suggestions include:
// - Field to enrich
// - Suggested value
// - Confidence score (0-1)
// - Reasoning and sources

// Generate searchable tags
tags, _ := enricher.GeneratePlayerTags(ctx, player, stats)
// Returns: ["deep-threat", "wr1", "elite-speed", "red-zone-target"]

// Create AI-written summaries
summary, _ := enricher.GeneratePlayerSummary(ctx, player, stats)
// Returns: "Tyreek Hill is the Dolphins' primary deep threat..."

// Find comparable players
similar, _ := enricher.SuggestRelatedPlayers(ctx, player)
// Returns: ["Stefon Diggs", "CeeDee Lamb", "A.J. Brown"]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Fill in missing college, draft info, measurements
- Generate player descriptions for UI
- Create comparison groups
- Improve search with semantic tags

---

### 3. **Query Translator** - Natural Language to SQL

**Location**: `internal/ai/query_translator.go`

**What it does**:
- Converts plain English to SQL queries
- Ensures queries are safe and optimized
- Explains results in natural language
- Generates insights from data

**Features**:

```go
translator := ai.NewQueryTranslator(aiService)

// Natural language to SQL
query, _ := translator.TranslateQuery(ctx,
    "Who are the top 5 rushing leaders this season?")

// Returns:
// SQL: "SELECT p.name, SUM(gs.rushing_yards) as total_yards..."
// Explanation: "This finds players with most rushing yards in 2025"
// Safety: "safe"
// Estimated rows: 5

// Generate insights from results
insights, _ := translator.GenerateDataInsights(ctx, query, results, rowCount)
// Returns AI analysis of what the data shows

// Explain results naturally
explanation, _ := translator.ExplainQueryResults(ctx, naturalQuery, count, sample)
// Returns: "Saquon Barkley leads with 1,234 rushing yards..."
```

**Safety Features**:
- Only allows SELECT statements
- Blocks dangerous operations (DROP, DELETE, etc.)
- Adds LIMIT clauses automatically
- Validates against known schema
- Returns safety level with each query

**Example Queries**:
```
"Show me all QBs with over 300 passing yards last week"
"Which teams have the most injuries right now?"
"Top 10 receivers by fantasy points this season"
"Games between Chiefs and Bills in 2024"
```

---

### 4. **Sync Scheduler** - Predictive Data Updates

**Location**: `internal/ai/sync_scheduler.go`

**What it does**:
- Intelligently schedules data syncs
- Adapts to game days, peak hours, seasons
- Predicts when users will need specific data
- Optimizes resource usage

**Features**:

```go
scheduler := ai.NewSyncScheduler(aiService)

// Generate intelligent sync plan
plan, _ := scheduler.GenerateSyncPlan(ctx)

// Plan includes:
// - Game day mode (true/false)
// - Prioritized sync recommendations
// - Reasoning for each sync
// - Next sync times

// Recommendations:
// [
//   {sync: "games", priority: "critical", reason: "game day", next: 15min},
//   {sync: "injuries", priority: "high", reason: "daily update", next: 4hr},
//   {sync: "stats", priority: "medium", reason: "games ended", next: 1hr}
// ]

// Check if should sync now
shouldSync, reason, _ := scheduler.ShouldSyncNow(ctx, "games", lastSync)
// Returns: true, "game day - sync every 30 minutes"

// Predict peak usage times
peakTimes, _ := scheduler.PredictDataUsage(ctx, "player_stats")
// Returns: [2:00 PM (pre-game), 9:00 PM (post-game), 10:00 AM (analysis)]
```

**Smart Scheduling**:
- **Game Days**: Frequent syncs (every 15-30 min)
- **Off Days**: Less frequent (hourly/daily)
- **Peak Hours**: Pre-cache before user surge
- **Night Time**: Only critical updates
- **Trade Deadline**: Roster syncs increase

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Game Day Auto-Healing

**Morning (Pre-Game)**:
```
[08:00] Data Gardener runs health check
[08:01] Detects: 16 games marked "scheduled" for today
[08:02] AI Scheduler: "Game day detected - enable high-frequency mode"
[08:05] Sync games every 15 minutes starting at 12:00 PM
```

**During Games**:
```
[13:05] Auto-sync detects Chiefs 21, Bills 17 (Q2)
[13:06] Updates scores in database
[13:07] Cache invalidated automatically
[13:15] Next auto-sync
```

**Post-Game**:
```
[16:30] All games final
[16:35] Data Gardener detects: "3 completed games missing stats"
[16:36] Auto-triggers NFLverse stats sync
[16:45] Stats loaded, issue auto-fixed
```

### Example 2: Natural Language Queries

**User asks**: "Who are the best wide receivers for fantasy this week?"

**AI Translator**:
1. Generates SQL:
```sql
SELECT p.name, p.position, t.abbreviation,
       SUM(gs.receiving_yards) as rec_yards,
       SUM(gs.receiving_tds) as rec_tds,
       COUNT(gs.id) as games
FROM players p
JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
JOIN game_stats gs ON gs.player_id = p.id
JOIN games g ON gs.game_id = g.id
WHERE p.position = 'WR'
  AND g.season_year = 2025
  AND g.week >= 1
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, t.abbreviation
ORDER BY (SUM(gs.receiving_yards) + SUM(gs.receiving_tds) * 60) DESC
LIMIT 10
```

2. Executes safely
3. Returns results with AI insights:
   > "Justin Jefferson leads with 1,234 receiving yards and 12 TDs through 10 games. CeeDee Lamb and Tyreek Hill round out the top 3. All three are elite WR1 options for fantasy playoffs."

### Example 3: Intelligent Enrichment

**Scenario**: New player "John Smith" added to database

**Data Enricher**:
```
[10:00] Detected new player: John Smith (WR)
[10:01] Missing: college, draft_year, height, weight
[10:02] AI Analysis: "Rookie WR, likely 2025 draft"
[10:03] Suggestions generated:
        - draft_year: 2025 (confidence: 0.95)
        - height: 73 inches (typical for WR, confidence: 0.70)
        - weight: 195 lbs (typical for WR, confidence: 0.70)
[10:04] Low confidence fields flagged for manual review
[10:05] Generated tags: ["rookie", "wr-prospect", "2025-draft"]
[10:06] Created summary: "John Smith is a rookie wide receiver..."
```

          "reason": "Game day - injury updates common",
          "estimated_time": "2-5 minutes",
          "next_sync_in": "1h"
        },

          "estimated_time": "10-15 minutes",
          "next_sync_in": "24h"
        }
      ],
      "ai_provider": "grok"
    },
    "message": "Generated schedule with 4 sync recommendations"
  }
}
```

**Schedule adapts to**:
- Day of week (game days vs off days)
- Time of day (business hours, night, morning)
- NFL season phase (preseason, regular, playoffs, offseason)
- Current game status (pre-game, in-progress, post-game)

## Tips

### Writing Good Natural Language Queries

**Good**:
- "Top 5 rushing leaders this season"
- "QBs with over 300 passing yards last week"
- "Players on the Chiefs roster"
- "Games in week 5 of 2024 season"

**Too Vague**:
- "Good players" (define "good")
- "Recent games" (specify timeframe)
- "Stats" (which stats, for whom?)

**Pro Tip**: Be specific about:
- Time periods (this season, last week, 2024)
- Metrics (passing yards, TDs, fantasy points)
- Filters (position, team, status)

## Integration Example

```javascript
// JavaScript client
async function askGarden(question) {
  const response = await fetch('https://nfl.wearemachina.com/api/v1/garden/query', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-API-Key': 'your-key'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query: question })
  });

  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    results: data.data.results,
    insights: data.data.insights,
    sql: data.data.sql  // See what SQL was generated
  };
}

// Use it
const result = await askGarden("Who leads in touchdowns?");
console.log(result.insights);
// "Patrick Mahomes leads with 32 TDs..."
```

## Auto-Fetch System

The API includes intelligent auto-fetching that automatically retrieves missing data when queried.

### How It Works

1. You query an endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/games?season=2025&week=1`)
2. If the database returns empty results:
   - System automatically fetches data from ESPN API
   - Stores it in the database
   - Returns the freshly fetched data
3. Response includes `X-Auto-Fetched: true` header

### Supported Auto-Fetch

- **Games**: Automatically fetches game schedules
- **Players**: Fetches rosters when individual player missing
- **Stats**: Fetches game statistics from NFLverse
- **Teams**: Ensures all 32 teams exist

### Example

```http
GET /api/v1/games?season=2025&week=1

Response Headers:
X-Auto-Fetched: true
X-Cache: MISS
```

The first request may take 2-10 seconds, but subsequent requests are served instantly from the database.

---

## Best Practices

### Pagination
Always use `limit` and `offset` for large datasets:
```http
GET /api/v1/players?limit=50&offset=0
```

### Caching
Check `X-Cache` header to monitor cache performance:
```http
X-Cache: HIT  # Served from cache (fast)
X-Cache: MISS # Queried database (slower)
```

### Rate Limits
Monitor rate limit headers to avoid 429 errors:
```http
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
```

### AI Endpoints
- Cache AI results client-side (responses rarely change)
- Use specific queries for better accuracy
- Monitor `ai_provider` field for provider transparency

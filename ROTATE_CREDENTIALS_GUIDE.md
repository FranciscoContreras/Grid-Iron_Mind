## What to Do Next

Once you have your new credentials:

### Option 1: Use the automated script
```bash
./complete-yahoo-oauth.sh
```
The script will ask you to paste the new credentials.

### Option 2: Set manually
```bash
heroku config:set YAHOO_CLIENT_ID="paste_new_client_id_here"
heroku config:set YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET="paste_new_client_secret_here"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my app in the list"

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're logged in with the correct Yahoo account
- Check if you created the app with a different Yahoo account
- The app might have been deleted - you'll need to create a new one

### "I don't see a Regenerate button"

**Solution**:
- Yahoo may not allow secret regeneration for this app type
- Use Method B: Delete and recreate the app

### "I forgot to copy the Client Secret"

**Solution**:
- You'll need to regenerate it again
- OR delete and recreate the app
- There's no way to view the secret after closing the page

### "The create app form looks different"

**Solution**:
- Yahoo updates their UI sometimes
- Look for similar fields
- The key fields you need:
  - App name
  - Callback/Redirect URL
  - API permissions (Fantasy Sports)

---

## Alternative: Use Yahoo's New App Registration (If Available)

Some accounts may see a newer interface:

1. Go to: https://developer.yahoo.com/oauth2/guide/openid_connect/getting_started.html
2. Click "Create an app"
3. Choose "Private app" or "Public app"
4. Follow similar steps as above

2. Check Yahoo's developer forums
3. Or just delete and recreate - it's the safest option

## Security Reminder

‚ö†Ô∏è **After you rotate**:
- Old credentials are now invalid
- Anyone who found the old credentials can't use them
- New credentials are secure (as long as you keep them secret!)

üîí **Best practices**:
- Never commit credentials to Git
- Always use environment variables
- Rotate regularly (every 6-12 months)

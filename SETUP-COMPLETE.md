## Monitoring

### View Live Logs
```bash
make logs
```

### Check Sync Status
```bash
# View recent syncs
tail -20 logs/sync-2025.log

# Check for errors
grep ERROR logs/sync-2025.log
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check game count
SELECT season, COUNT(*) as games
FROM games
WHERE season = 2025
GROUP BY season;
-- Expected: 272 games

-- Check player stats
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_season_stats
WHERE season = 2025;
-- Expected: 1000+ players with stats

-- Check team stats
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_team_stats gts
JOIN games g ON gts.game_id = g.id
WHERE g.season = 2025 AND g.status = 'completed';
-- Expected: 2 records per completed game
```

## Manual Commands

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Build
go build -o bin/sync2025 cmd/sync2025/main.go

# Full sync (first time)
./bin/sync2025 full

| Update | 2-5 min | ~50 MB | Low (incremental) |
| Live | Continuous | ~5 MB/sync | Very Low |
| Stats | 10-15 min | ~100 MB | Medium |
| Injuries | 1-2 min | ~5 MB | Very Low |
